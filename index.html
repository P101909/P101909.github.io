        <h2>Hackathon Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/P101909/Langara-Hacks-2024" target="_blank">Let's Be Delusional</a> - A
                chrome
                extension to help with dating communication. It scans a series of texts between two potential partners
                and gives back a score on how likey it is that they end up dating eachother. This was achived with the
                help of OpenAI. We did not launch this project and used node.js for the local server, and a chrome
                extension template.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/P101909/FallHacks2024-SFU" target="_blank">Youtibe Summerizer</a>A Website
                that
                accepts a Youtube link and gives back a quick summary. We achieved this by using the Youtube API to get
                the transcript, which then we fed to OpenAI for a summary. Similarly to let's be dulsiona,l, we did not
                lunch and hosted it loclay using node.js</li>
